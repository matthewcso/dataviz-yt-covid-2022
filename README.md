### From science to politics: COVID-19 information fatigue on YouTube - figure generation
Note that these scripts were intended for use as a part of a larger pipeline utilizing Dr. Jonathan Dushoff's [shellpipes](https://github.com/dushoff/shellpipes) workflow and have been reuploaded from the original repo (written by myself) otherwise unmodified. The intent of this repo is primarily to show the generating code for the figures in [From science to politics: COVID-19 information fatigue on YouTube](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-13151-7) and may not be directly reproducible from this code for these reasons.
